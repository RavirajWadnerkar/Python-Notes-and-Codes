A variable is like a box with a name in which you can store a value.
To store a value in a variable, you need to define a variable.
You can do this in the following format: variable_name = value.
The = operator in Python does not mean "equal". This assignment operator means assign the value on the right to the variable on the left.
Note that variable names don't need to be enclosed in quotes.


Printing a Variable

Now let's learn how to print the value in the name variable.
You can do this by writing print(name).
Note that if you enclose the variable in quotes, like print('name'), the name becomes a string instead of a variable.
Therefore, the output will be name, not the value of the variable.
