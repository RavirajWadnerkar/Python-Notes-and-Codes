The + operator that we used for calculations also lets us combine strings.
Combining strings is called string concatenation.
String concatenation can be used with strings and variables that have string values.


print('Hello ' + 'Python')
                joins strings
name = 'Ravi'

print('My name is ' + name)
        can join a string and a variable!
