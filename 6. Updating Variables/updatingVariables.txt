Updating the Value of a Variable ( 1 )

This time we will update the value of a variable that is already defined.
You can overwrite a variable simply by assigning a new value to it.

x=5
print(x)

x=11
    overwrite the value by assigning 11 to the variable x.
print(x)

Updating the Value of a Variable ( 2 )

In order to add some number to a variable, you can assign the sum of the variable and the number to the variable itself.
This may seem strange, but remember that = means assign, not equal.

x=5
print(x)

x = x + 3
    Add 3 to the varible x
print(x)

Updating the Value of a Variable ( 3 )

You can use shorthand operators like in the image below when updating a variable that has an integer value.
All kinds of calculations have a similar syntax.

Standard          shorthand
x = x + 10   ->   x += 10
