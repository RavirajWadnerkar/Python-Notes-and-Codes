You can use numbers like integers in programming.

Unlike strings, they don't need to be enclosed in quotes.

You can add and subtract integers just like you do in math.

The spaces before and after operators are not required, but they will make the code easier to read.


Difference between Strings and Integers

Strings and integers are interpreted differently in programming.

print(3 + 5)                      print('3 + 5')

3 + 5 will print 8, which is the result of the addition. 

However, if you enclose it in quotes and make it a string, the output will stay as 3 + 5.
